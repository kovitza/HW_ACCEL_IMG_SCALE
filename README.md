# HW_ACCEL_IMG_SCALE
Course: Digital VLSI Systems
University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering

This project focuses on accelerating image scaling through hardware and software.
The primary objective is to compare the performance of software-based image scaling, implemented in C, with hardware-accelerated scaling using a custom VHDL-based accelerator (acc_scale).
The results show a significant performance boost when using hardware acceleration, making it a valuable solution for fast image processing tasks.
